# MLB_ScoreBoard
This application grabs information from a baseball statistics API for a given calendar day that the user has selected. Once that data is retrieved as JSON it is then deserialized into classes and cached in memory for later use. Some basic data about baseball games that happened on that day is displayed for the user to see.  When the user closes the program all the information that is stored in memory is serialized back to JSON and appended to a text document so it can be loaded back into memory the next time the application is used. This program was written in C# and the front end was built with WCF. The Newtonsoft JSON library is used to aid in JSON manipulation. This is a great example of how very inconsistent JSON objects can be serialized into concrete classes and how data can be cached for later use to avoid excessive calls to a server.
